          Brontosaurus (/ˌbrɒntəˈsɔːrəs/;[1][2] meaning "thunder lizard" from
          the Greek words βροντή, brontē "thunder" and σαῦρος, sauros "lizard")
          is a genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur that lived in the United
          States during the Late Jurassic period. It was described by American
          paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879, the type species being
          dubbed B. excelsus, based on a partial skeleton lacking a skull found
          in Como Bluff, Wyoming. In subsequent years, two more species of
          Brontosaurus were named: B. parvus in 1902 and B. yahnahpin in 1994.
          Brontosaurus lived about 156 to 146 million years ago (mya) during the
          Kimmeridgian and Tithonian ages in the Morrison Formation of what is
          now Utah and Wyoming. For decades, the animal was thought to have been
          a taxonomic synonym of its close relative Apatosaurus, though a 2015
          study by Emmanuel Tschopp and colleagues found it to be distinct. It
          has seen widespread representation in popular culture, being the
          archetypal "long-necked" dinosaur in general media.
        </p>
        <p>
          The anatomy of Brontosaurus is well known, with fossils demonstrating
          that it was large, long-necked, and quadrupedal with a long tail
          terminating in a whip-like structure. The cervical vertebrae are
          notably extremely robust and heavily-built, in contrast to its lightly
          built relatives Diplodocus and Barosaurus. The forelimbs were short
          and stout whereas the hindlimbs were elongated and thick, supported
          respectively by a heavily built shoulder girdle and pelvis. Several
          size estimates have been made, with the largest species B. excelsus
          reaching up to 21–22 m (69–72 ft) from head to tail and weighing in at
          15–17 t (17–19 short tons), whereas the smaller B. parvus only got up
          to 19 m (62 ft) long. Juvenile specimens of Brontosaurus are known,
          with younger individuals growing rapidly to adult size in as little as
          15 years.

          Brontosaurus has been classified within the family Diplodocidae, which
          was a group of sauropods that had shorter necks and longer tails
          compared to other families like brachiosaurs and mamenchisaurs.
          Diplodocids first evolved in the Middle Jurassic but peaked in
          diversity during the Late Jurassic with forms like Brontosaurus before
          becoming extinct in the Early Cretaceous. Brontosaurus is a genus in
          the subfamily Apatosaurinae, which includes only it and Apatosaurus,
          which are distinguished by their firm builds and thick necks. Although
          Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until
          an extensive 2015 paper, which found Brontosaurus to be valid.
          However, the status of Brontosaurus is still uncertain, with some
          paleontologists still considering it a synonym of Apatosaurus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being from the Morrison Formation, Brontosaurus coexisted with a
          menagerie of other taxa such as the sauropods Diplodocus, Barosaurus,
          and Brachiosaurus; herbivorous ornithischians Stegosaurus, Dryosaurus,
          and Nanosaurus; as well as the carnivorous theropods Allosaurus,
          Marshosaurus and Ceratosaurus. This formation was a hotspot of
          sauropod biodiversity, with over 16 recognized genera, which resulted
          in niche partitioning between the shorter-necked diplodocids and
          longer-necked macronarians.
