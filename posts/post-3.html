          Velociraptor (/vəˌlɒsɪˈræptər, vəˈlɒsɪræptər/;[1] lit. 'swift thief')
          is a genus of small dromaeosaurid dinosaur that lived in Asia during
          the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 75 million to 71 million years ago.
          Two species are currently recognized, although others have been
          assigned in the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis; fossils of
          this species have been discovered in the Djadochta Formation,
          Mongolia. A second species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull
          material from the Bayan Mandahu Formation, China.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator,
          Velociraptor was about 1.5–2.07 m (4.9–6.8 ft) long with a body mass
          around 14.1–19.7 kg (31–43 lb). It nevertheless shared many of the
          same anatomical features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a
          long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which
          is thought to have been used to tackle and restrain prey. Velociraptor
          can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low
          skull, with an upturned snout.

          Velociraptor (commonly referred to as "raptor") is one of the dinosaur
          genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role
          in the Jurassic Park films. In real life, however, Velociraptor was
          roughly the size of a turkey, considerably smaller than the
          approximately 2 m (6.6 ft) tall and 90 kg (200 lb) reptiles seen in
          the novels and films (which were based on members of the related genus
          Deinonychus). Today, Velociraptor is well known to paleontologists,
          with over a dozen described fossil skeletons, the most of any
          dromaeosaurid. One particularly famous specimen preserves a
          Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops.
